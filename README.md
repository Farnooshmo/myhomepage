Welcome to my very first personal 
[webpage](https://farnoosh-homepage.netlify.app/)! Here you will find a few key elements:
- A navigation bar.
- A profile picture.
- A brief introduction.
- A YouTube video.
- A rating section with emojis.
- A form for submitting feedback.
- Links to my social media accounts.
  
__The technologies used in this project are:__

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
__Challenges I faced:__

- Aligned the navbar items.
- The profile picture resizing.
- Linked an embeded video from YouTube.
- Adding emojis to the rating section.
